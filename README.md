# The Knowledge App

It is a rather simple Q&A web app made with django and wrongly named quiz :(
It is actually no quiz as that would require some time limit for answering any question which is clearly not the case (atleast for now).

To run it you would need -
1. **Python 3.6** (or greater)
2. **Django 2.2 **(or greater)

After installing those two just go into project directory and run `python manage.py runserver`

------------

It was made as a part of the software engineering course in college and I will take this project further if I get the time and motivation to do so.
> PS: Chishiki Hanto means Knowledge Hunter in Japanese.

If you are interested in learning django than Django guide on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django "MDN") is a great place to start in my opinion.
